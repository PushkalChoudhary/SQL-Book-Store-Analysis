# ðŸ“š Book Store Sales Analysis (Using SQL)
This project uses fictional data from an online bookstore that tracks books, customers, and orders.
The goal is to analyze business performance using SQL:
What are customers buying?
Which genres and authors are most popular?
Where is the store earning the most revenue?
It simulates the kind of data an e-commerce bookstore (like Amazon Books) might track to make better decisions.
